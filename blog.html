                1: What is the differences between Local Storage and Session
                Storage?
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Local storage and session storage are found at application tab
                in Developer tools. Though they both work in the same process
                but there are some differences which make them different. Take a
                look:
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Data stored in Local storage has no expiration date. If once
                data is saved in local storage, then it remains until user
                remove the data. That means, browser doesn't take any step to
                remove the data.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                On the other hand, Session storage's data erased after closing
                the browser or tab! So, it has limit and expiration date.

                2: What is the differences between Global Scope and Block Scope?
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Scope means the region of a program where a variable can be
                accessible. There are two types of scope in javascript.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                <span class="text-decoration-underline">Global Scope</span
                ><br />
                Global means the entire program region. If a variable or
                function declared in global scope, it can be accessible in
                anywhere of the program.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                <span class="text-decoration-underline">Local Scope</span>
                <br />
                Local Scope has limited access region. If we define any variable
                inside the curly brace, { }, then those variable are local to
                that region. Though we can access global variable inside the
                local scope, local scope's variable isn't accessible outside the
                local scope.

            <p class="ms-5">
                Javascript's event loop is responsible for executing the code and other stuffs of events. When we talk about event loop, there comes up two topics: Stack and Queue.
                
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                We know javascript is a single threaded language. It's a asynchronous language. When a javascript code executes, the event are stored in Stack which is 'First-In Last-Out'. At the same time, some events like setInterval or fetch are kept in Queue which is 'First-In First-Out'. And after processing the synchronous tasks, queue's tasks are joined to executed.

            </h5>
            <p class="ms-5">
                There are many ways responsible to produce 'undefined'. Some of them are listed below: 
                
            </p>
            <ul class="ms-5">
                <li>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
                <li>A function that has no return statement</li>
                <li>A parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
                <li>Only return keyword returns undefined value</li>
                <li>A object property that doesn't exists weill produce undefined</li>
                <li>If array index is out of the range of array, it certainly provide undefined</li>
            </ul>
